    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of how efficient an algorithm is. It determines the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity is another critical factor in algorithm analysis. It measures the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run as a function of the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> is often denoted using Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size.</p>
